EMC3 - Online Platform for Citizen Calling Campaigns

Introduction

This platform is used to crowd-source the telephone canvassing of prospective voters.
In its current state, the platform does not call voters directly.
It only provides voter numbers which then have to be dialed by the users using their own devices.


Workflow

- Interested volunteers can goto the registration page to enter their details and create an account.
- A user account gets activated once he/she verifies his email address by opening a verification email.
- The platform allows the logged in user to get the phone number of prospective voter.
- After calling the prospective voter, the user has to fill a voter response form.
- After filling the form, the user gets the phone number of another voter, and so on.

Technical Details

- The entire UI is written in PHP and styled using CSS, with some use of jQuery. It is mobile-friendly.
- The backend is in MySQL.
- The number of queries per page load have been minimized by using PHP caching.
- All global and initialzing variables are defined in PHP files of the includes folder.
- details.php is the main calling page on which a user will land when they login.
- There is a separate section for admins, where they can create campaigns, see user stats, and block users.
